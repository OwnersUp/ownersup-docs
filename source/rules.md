OwnersUp groups are at their most effective when the environment is engaged, honest & supportive. Because of that, the health of the group is one of top priorities.

One way that we support that prority is to make sure the the expectations on each member is a clear as possible. Towards that end, we have developed **The Rules**. This is our code of conduct. The standard by which we expect each person to hold themselves to.

### 1. Protect the privacy of your group members



### 2. Protect the businesses of your group members



### 3. Protect the dignity of your group members

There is never an excuse to speak down to somone and to single them out based on their intelligence, race....

### 4. Treat the weekly huddle as a serious commitment

The weekly huddle sets the tone and goals for the entire group. Don't be a flake. We understand and expect that missing a call will have to happen at some point, missing more than one call is generally not a good sign.

Respect yourself and your group by being on time.

If you have to miss a call, or will be late, message your group as soon as you know.

### 5. Work together responsibly

We encourage group members to barter work and share resources. But please do so responsibly. If things go poorly it has the potential to seriously impact, if not flat our ruin, the group dynamic.

### 6. Provide 30 days notice before leaving a group

Try and think ahead about whether you will be leaving your group. We understand that circumstances can change, but giving us some heads up helps us make sure we can line up another person who be a good fit for your group.
