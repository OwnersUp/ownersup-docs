We have you categorize your accomplishments to help you understand how you are spending your time.

### The cagtegories

1. **Revenue:** Any activity that is generating new money
2. **Retention:**: Any activity that keeps clients happy and around. This includes upselling them.
3. **Systems:** Any activity that helps you scale your time so you can save time and make more money
4. **Partnerships:** Any activity that is done towards a potential referral source of new prospects
5. **Other:** Everything that doesn't fall into the above categories. Just because an activity is "Other" doesn't mean that it's not important. Bookkeeping, accounting, research and planning are critical business functions. However, they don't directly drive revenue and should be taking up most of your time.
